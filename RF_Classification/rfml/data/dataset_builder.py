    """Builder pattern for programmatic creation of a Dataset

    Args:
        n (int, optional): Length of the time window (number of samples)
            that each entry in the dataset should have.  If it is not
            provided, then it is inferred from the first added example.
            Defaults to None.
        keys (Set[str], optional): A set of column headers that will
            be included as metadata for all examples.  If it is not
            provided, then it is inferred from the first added example.
            Subsequent examples that are added must either have all of
            these keys provided as metadata or they must be defined in
            the defaults below. Defaults to None.
        defaults (Dict[str, Union, optional): A mapping of default
            metadata values that will be included for each example if
            they aren't overridden. Defaults to dict().

    Examples:

        >>> iq = np.zeros((2, 1024))
        >>> db = DatasetBuilder()
        >>> db.add(iq, Modulation="BPSK")
        >>> db.add(iq, Modulation="QPSK")
        >>> dataset = db.build()

    Raises:
        ValueError: If both keys and defaults are provided, but, the
            defaults have additional keys that were not provided.
        ValueError: If n is negative or 0.
